 
Hey, I am Marina :) 
Welcome to my github repository. Here you will find small personal projects and study notes. 

I studied biological sciences and from the beginning of my course I was interested in informatics and data science, and that was my gateway to the tech universe.

Currently I work as a Software Consultant and study software engineering. My main interests at the moment are:

-Cloud computing
