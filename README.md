 
Hey, I am Marina :) 
Welcome to my github repository. Here you will find small personal projects and study notes. 

I studied biological sciences and from the beginning of my course I was interested in informatics and data science, and that was my gateway to the tech universe.

Currently I work as a Software Consultant. My main interests are:

-Cloud computing

-Data Engineering

-DevOps and infrastructure
